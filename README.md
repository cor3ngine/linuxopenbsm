linuxopenbsm
============

Linux OpenBSM is a Kernel Module that interacts with the OpenBSM audit daemon tool through BSM audit trails.

This audit system was developed originally by SUN Microsystem and today is implemented in many UNIX Operating Systems such as Solaris, MacOS X and FreeBSD.

Linux OpenBSM aims to bring this capability even on Linux systems.
